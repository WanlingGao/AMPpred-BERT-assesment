(1)Peptide sequences were longer than 100 or shorter than 10 in length, and containing non-standard residues, such as 'B', 'J', 'O', 'U', 'X', or 'Z', were excluded from the analysis. 
(2) Used the CD-HIT tool to filter out the sequences, excluding sequences that exhibited a shared sequence identity of 40% or higher with any other sequence within the same subset. 
(3)Compare the test set with the original training sets of the models, and remove the identical sequences in the collected datasets and the training set.


Negative samples download from Uniprot(http://www.uniprot.org)


(1) Downloaded peptide sequences from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org), and all peptide sequences containing 'antibacterial' related keywords were removed. 
(2)Sequences with a length greater than 100 or less than 10 amino acids and non-standard residues "B", "J", "O", "U", "X" or "Z" were also removed.
(3) Used the CD-HIT tool to filter out the sequences, excluding sequences that exhibited a shared sequence identity of 40% or higher with any other sequence within the same subset.
